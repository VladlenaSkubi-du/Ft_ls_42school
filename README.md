# Ft_ls_42school
Ft_ls recodes (but not fully) the Unix command that lists files in the directories given as arguments. Original ls suggests the following flags that influence the list output:

    original: -ABCFGHLOPRSTUWabcdefghiklmnopqrstuwx1

This ft_ls-program deals with the following flags:

    ft_ls: -1CFGRSacdfglprstu

# Usage
You need to compile the program and then use it according to the usage the original ls-command has.

So, your steps -

Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/VladlenaSkubi-du/Ft_ls_42school.git [folder's name you want]

Get into it and compile the ft_ls-program:

    cd [folder's name you want]
    make

After you make:

    ./ft_ls [flag] [directory-name or file-name or any staff you want]

For example:

    ./ft_ls -l .. or 
    ./ft_ls -GC /usr / ~/Downloads Makefile aaa

Paralelly you can check the output using the same arguments for original ls-command and ft_ls-program. I hope it will show the same results.

Go and try. Good luck!

# The program returns
The same output as the original ls-command with all the flags described in the first part of README.
- If you input a directory (".", "..", "/", "~/Applications") as an argument, ft_ls program returns a list of files lying within this directory (or to say it in a more "scientific" way - listed in the catalogue with the same name and path as the argument you input).
- If you input a file name or a link name or a program name and so on as an argument, ft_ls program returns the names you input if they exist in the directory.
- If you input some staff that does not exist, ft_ls outputs: "./ft_ls: 1: No such file or directory".
- It can also answer as: "./ft_ls: Permission denied" if the files or directories you input as arguments are non-readable for you as user (your group of users).

You can also try special commands that this ft_ls reproduces as the original ls-command:

    ./ft_ls -aC / > test_file.txt

    mkdir l
    mv l -l
    ./ft_ls -a -- -u

Where flag "--" gives stop to ./ft_ls and says that further it will see only arguments but not flags. The following command will be long because it will show all the files under the root-user (all the files in the system):

	./ft_ls -RG ~/

The last command will be beautiful and list all the files lying in the home-directoty and its sub-directories.
